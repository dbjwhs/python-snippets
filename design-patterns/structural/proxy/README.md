# Proxy Design Pattern

The Proxy design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control
access to it. First formalized in the Gang of Four's seminal 1994 book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,"
the pattern's roots trace back to early distributed systems and remote procedure calls (RPC) in the 1980s. The pattern emerged
from the need to represent expensive or remote resources in a lightweight manner, allowing systems to defer the actual
creation or access of these resources until absolutely necessary. Historically, it evolved alongside the growth of distributed
computing and client-server architectures, becoming increasingly important with the rise of web services and microservices architectures.
This is a simple version of the proxy pattern; I used a robust version of this at VMware for VADP login objects for our VDR product.

## Use Cases and Problem Solutions

The Proxy pattern addresses several common software design challenges:

1. Virtual Proxy (Lazy Loading)
    - Loading large images or documents only when they're actually viewed
    - Initializing expensive database connections only when first used
    - Creating heavyweight objects on demand to improve startup time
    - Caching frequently accessed but expensive to compute results

2. Protection Proxy (Access Control)
    - Implementing role-based access control to sensitive resources
    - Adding authentication layers to existing services
    - Controlling access to shared resources in a distributed system
    - Managing permissions in document management systems

3. Remote Proxy
    - Representing objects that exist on remote servers
    - Handling network communication details transparently
    - Implementing local caching for remote resources
    - Managing distributed system interfaces

4. Smart Reference
    - Counting references to shared resources
    - Automatically freeing resources when no longer needed
    - Checking constraints before allowing access
    - Logging access patterns for optimization

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Proxy Structure
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class ISubject(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def request(self) -> None:
        pass

class RealSubject(ISubject):
    def request(self) -> None:
        # actual work
        pass

class Proxy(ISubject):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._real_subject = RealSubject()
        
    def request(self) -> None:
        # Add behavior before/after forwarding
        self._real_subject.request()
```

### Common Use Case: Image Loading
```python
class ImageProxy:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._heavy_image = None
    
    def display(self) -> str:
        if not self._heavy_image:
            self._heavy_image = self._load_expensive_image()
        return self._heavy_image.display()
    
    def _load_expensive_image(self) -> 'HeavyImage':
        # Load the real image
        return HeavyImage()
```

## Advantages
- Separation of concerns: proxy can handle aspects like logging, access control without modifying the real subject
- Resource management: can implement lazy loading and caching
- Remote access: can hide complexity of accessing remote resources
- Security: can add authentication and authorization layers

## Disadvantages
- Added complexity: introduces new classes and interfaces
- Potential performance impact: proxy adds an extra layer of indirection
- Response time: in remote proxies, network latency can be significant
- Maintenance: proxy must be updated when real subject interface changes

## Best Practices
1. Keep the proxy interface identical to the real subject
2. Consider using composition for resource management
3. Implement lazy initialization where appropriate
4. Use dependency injection to provide real subjects to proxies
5. Consider thread safety in concurrent applications

## When Not to Use
- When the added complexity outweighs the benefits
- For simple objects with no need for access control or lazy loading
- When performance is critical and the proxy overhead is unacceptable
- When the real subject interface changes frequently

1. "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" (1994)
    - Authors: Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides
    - Contains the original formal definition of the pattern

2. "Head First Design Patterns" (2004)
    - Authors: Freeman, Robson, Bates, Sierra

## Modern Applications

The proxy pattern has found new relevance in modern software development:

1. Microservices Architecture
    - API gateways acting as proxies
    - Service mesh implementations
    - Circuit breakers and fail over handling

2. Web Development
    - JavaScript Proxy objects for reactive programming
    - Service workers as proxies for network requests
    - Vue.js reactive data handling

3. Cloud Computing
    - Load balancers as proxies
    - Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
    - Cloud storage access patterns
