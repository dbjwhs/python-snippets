# Fail-Fast Pattern Implementation in Python

The Fail-Fast pattern is a robust error-handling strategy that emerged in the 1970s during the early days of defensive programming.
Originally developed at institutions like Bell Labs and IBM, it gained significant traction during the object-oriented programming boom
of the 1990s. The pattern's core principle is immediate termination upon encountering invalid states or operations, rather than
attempting to proceed with potentially corrupted data or unstable states. This approach revolutionized error detection and handling in
mission-critical systems, particularly in financial and safety-critical applications where data integrity is paramount.

## Installation

```bash
# Install with uv (recommended)
uv pip install -e .

# Install with development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from fail_fast import FailFastAccount
from icecream import ic

# Create account with validation
account = FailFastAccount("John Doe")

# Deposit with validation
account.deposit(1000.0)
ic(f"Balance: ${account.balance:.2f}")

# Withdraw with validation
account.withdraw(500.0)
ic(f"Remaining: ${account.balance:.2f}")

# This will fail fast
try:
    account.withdraw(2000.0)
except RuntimeError as e:
    ic(f"Error caught: {e}")
```

### Running the Package

```bash
# Run the package directly
python -m fail_fast

# Run the example
python examples/banking_example.py
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests with pytest
pytest

# Run type checking
mypy src

# Run linting
ruff check src tests examples
```

## Use Cases and Problem Solutions

The pattern effectively addresses several critical software development challenges. In complex systems, it prevents error cascading by
identifying issues at their source rather than at the point of failure impact. For debugging purposes, it provides precise error
locations and clear state information, significantly reducing troubleshooting time. The pattern is particularly valuable in
multi-threaded environments where early detection of inconsistencies can prevent race conditions and data corruption. It also excels in
systems requiring high reliability, such as financial transaction processing, where continuing with invalid states could lead to
significant issues.

## Implementation Examples

### Banking System Implementation
```python
class FailFastAccount:
    def _validate_state(self) -> None:
        if not self._is_active:
            raise RuntimeError("Account is inactive")
    
    # ... additional implementation details
```

### Data Processing Implementation
```python
class FailFastProcessor[T]:
    def process_data(self, data: T) -> None:
        if not self._validate_input(data):
            raise ValueError("Invalid input")
        # ... processing logic
```

## Best Practices

- Always validate object state before operations
- Use clear, specific exception messages
- Include detailed logging for debugging
- Validate input parameters immediately
- Maintain consistent state checks throughout the object lifecycle

## Common Pitfalls

- Over-aggressive validation leading to poor performance
- Unclear error messages that complicate debugging
- Inconsistent validation across different methods
- Failing to log sufficient context for debugging
- Ignoring edge cases in validation logic

## Performance Considerations

While the Fail-Fast pattern introduces additional validation overhead, the cost is typically minimal compared to the benefits:
- Early error detection reduces debugging time
- Prevents costly cascade failures
- Simplifies system recovery
- Improves system reliability

## Alternative Approaches

- Fail-Safe Pattern: Continues operation in a safe mode
- Circuit Breaker Pattern: Prevents system overload
- Defensive Programming: More general approach to error prevention

## Implementation Variations

The pattern can be implemented in various ways depending on requirements:
- Exception-based (as shown in our example)
- Return code-based
- Logging-based
- Assert-based

## Testing Strategies

- Unit tests for all validation scenarios
- Integration tests for state management
- Performance tests for validation overhead
- Edge case testing for boundary conditions
- Stress testing for concurrent operations
